As you may know, we have numerous teamspeak tags which are awarded for different reasons.  
As it stands, I don't like the way which these tags are managed. Because of this,  
I have decided that tags will be handled in a slightly different way.

From now on, tags are going to be earned in a more organized way, at the discretion of the  
clan officers. [Here](/teamspeak/tags/), you can find a list of all our current tags, as well  
as a general idea of what they are for.  However, they are not to be thought of as "achivements"  
to get or collect them all.  They can be earned or revoked at the discretion of the officers.  
Additionally, they are not to be asked for. If you ask for a tag, you probably are not going to get it.

Tomorrow, 1/12/16, all non-rank tags will be revoked. It is my hope that this will lead to a more even  
distribution of tags among clan members, with each tag to have a meaning behind it.  Finally, don't whine  
about losing your precious hitler tag or the any of that.  This is the decision I've made. You're free to  
voice your opinion, so that I may take it in to consideration when I make future decisions, but this will not be reversed.

As a final note to officers: If you don't have a good idea of what the tag actually means or what is for, ask me.  
Don't just go handing out tags for what you think they should mean.  Also, try to keep them somewhat exclusive.  
That is, don't give a ton of them out.  One here and one there is fine, but don't try to hand out tons of them.
